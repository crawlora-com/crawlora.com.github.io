Integrated project delivery (IPD) is another cornerstone of Crawlora's collaborative ethos. Unlike traditional project delivery methods where stakeholders operate in separate silos, IPD fosters a unified approach where all parties work together from the outset. This integrated approach promotes transparency, efficiency, and collective accountability, ultimately leading to superior project outcomes.
